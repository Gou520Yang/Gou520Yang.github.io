    <content><![CDATA[<p>Dear Yanzi Yang:</p>
<p>​         Time flies in the blink of an eye. It’s been more than half a year since we had a relationship. I talked about it for a long time before, saying that I want to build a simple website to record our time together, and finally have time to finish this thing today. Thank you for your company along the way, although occasionally there will be some twists and turns, but fortunately, love can overcome everything. The next four or five years will be a short and long period of time, because long-term off-site is a hard for love. There is always a feeling of “day and night thinking of the king but can’t see the king”, but I believe we can survive this difficulty, and finally the merits are complete, Cultivated into a positive result. At the same time, the study of a doctorate is very difficult and interesting. I don’t think it is too difficult for you. You have a good foundation, excellent supervisor, and the most important is the gentle and caring Boyfriend: Gou, I believe that the study life of the next doctoral career will be spent happily.</p>
