    <content><![CDATA[<p>Dear Yanzi Yang:</p>
<p>​         Time flies in the blink of an eye. It’s been more than half a year since we had a relationship. I talked about it for a long time before, saying that I want to build a simple website to record our time together, and finally have time to finish this thing today. Thank you for your company along the way, although occasionally there will be some twists and turns, but fortunately, love can overcome everything. The next four or five years will be a short and long period of time, because long-term off-site is a hard for love. There is always a feeling of “day and night thinking of the king but can’t see the king”, but I believe we can survive this difficulty, and finally the merits are complete, Cultivated into a positive result. At the same time, the study of a doctorate is very difficult and interesting. I don’t think it is too difficult for you. You have a good foundation, excellent supervisor, and the most important is the gentle and caring Boyfriend: Gou, I believe that the study life of the next doctoral career will be spent happily.</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                                                    yours truly</p>
<p>​                                                                                                                                                                    Jianing Gou</p>

    <title>one hour long phone dialog</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="one-hour-long-phone-dialog"><a href="#one-hour-long-phone-dialog" class="headerlink" title="one hour long phone dialog"></a>one hour long phone dialog</h2><p>7月5日周天，Yang非常想我，于是在早上8点打来电话，但是非常地意外，我既没有听到手机响铃，也没有醒来之后再查看手机地未接来电，但是我微信一早起来是会看的。说实话也巧，Yang并没有发微信，而是在中午一点多的时候发的微信，问我在干嘛。瞬时，我意识到这个问题不简单呐，果然一切都炸了。在之后的两个小时里，我内心非常自责，我最不想看到的是看到Yang因为我哭泣，也意识到作为男朋友，自己平时对于Yang确实关心不太够。Yang从受点委屈就嚎嚎大哭到不怎么哭，这也许是成熟的表现，但是这确是危险的信号，因为可能对我越来越失去信心和兴趣，所以我需要改变。</p>
<h2 id="past-and-now"><a href="#past-and-now" class="headerlink" title="past and now"></a>past and now</h2><p>过去，我把自己埋进海量的英文文献和编程中，就是希望能够有一天能和Yang一样优秀，多拿奖学金、多发文章。现在，我觉得爱情跟学习并不矛盾，大家都开开心心，做事情会事半功倍，并不是单独的疯狂堆积时间就能成功的。你中有我，我中有你，未来可期,加油。</p>
